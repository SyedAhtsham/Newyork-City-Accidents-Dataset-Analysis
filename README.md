It was really an amazing experience while working on this hands-on guided project. <br>
This project enhanced my expertise in pandas, numpy, pydeck, streamlit and plotly.express <br><br>

I worked on the Newyork City's accidents dataset in finding & visualizing:<br>
      1. the number of accidents that occurred at each location in NYC <br>
      2. the number and location of accidents that occurred during a given hour <br>
      3. breakdown of the number and location of accidents that occurred during each minute of a given hour <br>
      4. the most dangerous streets for Pedestrians, Cyclists, and Motorists based on the highest number of injuries <br>
